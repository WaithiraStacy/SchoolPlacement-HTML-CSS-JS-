School Placement System
Project Description
The School Placement System is a web-based application designed to automate the process of assigning secondary school placements based on a candidate's national examination score, gender, age, and special needs status. The system follows a set of predefined criteria to determine the most suitable school category and ensures that candidates are placed accordingly. If a candidate does not meet the minimum secondary school requirements, the system provides alternative options.
Features
•	Accepts user input for score, gender, age, and special needs status.
•	Validates if the candidate's age falls within the acceptable range (12-18 years).
•	Determines school placement based on the following examination score criteria:
o	National Schools (400-500 marks)
o	Extra County Schools (350-399 marks)
o	County Schools (250-349 marks)
o	Special Schools (for candidates with special needs & score ≥ 250)
o	Alternative Options (Vocational training or retaking the exam for candidates scoring below 250)
•	Ensures gender-based school assignment.
•	Provides real-time feedback on the placement decision.
Technologies Used
•	HTML for the structure of the webpage.
•	CSS for styling and layout.
•	JavaScript for input validation and decision-making logic.
How It Works
1.	The user enters the candidate's score, gender, age, and special needs status.
2.	The system validates the inputs to ensure they meet the defined criteria.
3.	Based on the input data, the system determines the appropriate school category.
4.	The placement result is displayed, showing the assigned school category.
5.	If the candidate does not qualify for secondary school, the system suggests alternative options such as vocational training or retaking the exam.

1.	Open the SchoolPlacement.html file in a web browser.
2.	Enter the required candidate details.
3.	Click the Submit button to view the placement result.
